# reactnative
This React Native project is designed to help you get started with building mobile apps. To set up the project first install the necessary dependencies by running npm install in your terminal. Start the Metro Bundler with npx react-native start and then you can run the app on an Android emulator or device using npx react-native run-android. The project structure includes a src/screens directory where screen components are stored and the main entry point is App.js. To add a new screen create a new file in the src/screens directory (e.g., NewScreen.js) and include your screen component code. If you encounter issues such as "No Android Project Found," ensure that the android directory exists within your project; if itâ€™s missing you might need to reinitialize the project.ts.
